# ioctl-tools
A couple of little tools I've made for working with Windows Drivers

## translate.py

## code_bruteforcer.py
Bruteforces valid ioctl codes and provides definitions for them when setup with valid config to send them to a driver.   
Correct settings will need to be added as arguments to the CreateFile call.
